## Overview of the Analysis

    The purpose of this analysis was to use the given data of the Pewlett Hackard
employee data and give a report of the the number of retiring employees.  Also,
the title by which they will be retiring was also to be reported.  Also, the data
was to be used to give the number of employees eligible for the Mentorship Program 
available to them.  There was a very large number of employees on the database so
SQL was used to analyze the data and give the results.
